**Unit 5: The Industrial Revolution** <span id="5"></span> 
*The Industrial Revolution is not a revolution in the same sense as the
previous units, but a series of long-term changes that reshaped first
Europe and then the world.  The Industrial Revolution does not have a
start or end date, and there is much disagreement on what constitutes a
‘revolution’ when referring to these changes.  The Industrial Revolution
involved new technologies and ideas, as well as long-term changes in the
social and economic relationships within Britain, Europe, and the wider
world.*  
    
 *The Industrial Revolution made countries that adapted to these changes
much more powerful economically, both overall and per capita, than
countries that did not.  These changes came at a price for many people
who saw their way of life and standard of living destroyed by the new
modes of production.  The revolutions of 1848 were in a large part
brought about by the changes the Industrial Revolution brought to
European society.*
