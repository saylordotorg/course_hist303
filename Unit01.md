**Unit 1: The Enlightenment and the Origins of the Revolutionary Age**
<span id="1"></span> 
*In the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, the Atlantic world was dominated by
European empires and their colonies.  Europe was ruled by monarchies,
many of them absolute.  Beginning in 1776, a series of revolutions shook
Europe and the Atlantic World.  European countries and colonies,
formerly ruled by aristocratic regimes, embraced new and radical
principles of self-governance and equality.  Absolute monarchies were
dismantled in Europe and independent republics emerged in the Americas.
 Although revolutionary fervor swept across Europe and the Americas
between 1776 and 1840, each revolution—whether in British America,
Haiti, France, or South America—had its own distinct character.      *  
        
 *In this unit, you will examine how the European Enlightenment and the
crisis of monarchy paved the way for the revolutionary age.  You will
also consider how the idea of equality took on increasing importance in
the Atlantic world during this time.*
