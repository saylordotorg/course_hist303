This course will introduce you to the history of the Age of Revolutions
in the Atlantic World from 1776 to 1848. You will learn about the
revolutionary upheavals that took place in the Americas and Europe
during this period. Each unit will include representative primary-source
documents that illustrate important overarching political, economic, and
social themes, such as the secession of the American colonies from the
British Empire, the outbreak of the French Revolution, the dissolution
of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires in the Americas, and the spread of
revolutionary ideals throughout the Atlantic World. Running alongside
and extending beyond these political revolutions is the First Industrial
Revolution. By the end of the course, you will understand how an
Atlantic World, dominated by European empires in 1776, was transformed
through revolution into a series of independent states by 1848 and of
the profound changes that Europe would experience, and continue to
experience, through the development and consolidation of capitalism.
