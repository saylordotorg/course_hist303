**Unit 4: Latin America and Caribbean Revolutions** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Beginning in the early 19th century, a spate of revolutions swept
through the European territories in the Americas.  The independence
movements that proliferated in Americas in the early 19<sup>th</sup>
century were a direct result of the American and French Revolutions, as
well as the Peninsular War, a conflict over the Iberian Peninsula during
the Napoleonic Wars.  The slave revolt in Haiti was the only truly
successful slave revolt, as well as the first of the new Independence
movements.  Napoleon Bonaparte dismantled the Spanish Bourbon monarchy,
allowing for the establishment of several junta governments in Spanish
America that advocated independence from Spain.  While Napoleon’s forces
occupied Portugal, the monarchy fled to Brazil, its South American
colony.  When the Portuguese king returned to Portugal in 1821, his
brother, the prince regent, declared Brazil independent of Portugal.
 The wars for independence that ensued in Central and South America
during this time resulted in protracted and bloody conflicts, the
adoption of free trade policies, the rise of many unstable regimes, and
the expansion of representative government. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will consider the many causes of the Latin American
and Caribbean Revolutions of the early 1800s as well the particular
character of each revolution.  You will also study how the revolutionary
movements helped better integrate Central and South America into the
world economy and forge alliances with America and Great Britain.*
