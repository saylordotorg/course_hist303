**Unit 2: The American Revolution** <span id="2"></span> 
*The American Revolution was the first of the Atlantic Revolutions.  The
roots of the American Revolution can be traced back to both the
Enlightenment and British concepts of Law and Representation.  The
tensions between Britain and her American colonies were exacerbated by
the French and Indian War, the subsequent taxes imposed on the colonies,
and British mercantile policies.  These tensions led to violence in
1775.  Unable to get their grievances addressed, the colonists
ultimately declared themselves independent in 1776.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will study why the revolutionaries went to war and
what they hoped to achieve through independence. You will also consider
the impact of the revolution on Europe and the Caribbean. *
