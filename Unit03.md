**Unit 3: The French Revolution** <span id="3"></span> 
*The French Revolution was the primary catalyst for spreading
revolutionary ideas throughout Europe.  The Ancient Regime had divided
the society into three estates: the clergy (first estate), the nobility
(second estate), and the townspeople and peasantry (third estate).  The
Revolution broke out when the third estate rebelled against the king as
well as the first two estates and proclaimed themselves the true
representative of the French people.  The French Revolution overthrew
the monarchy as well as the estate system and introduced new radical
ideas of government and what the nation meant.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will examine the causes of the French Revolution:
famine, poverty, the Enlightenment, and the outdated and oppressive
nature of the Ancient Regime.  You will also study the different phases
of the Revolution and the spread of revolutionary ideas.*

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this text.  The author, Peter Kropotkin,
    was an early 20<sup>th</sup> century Russian philosopher, renowned
    for his anarcho-communist ideas. In his text, Kropotkin, an
    authority in French history, describes the conditions of the French
    peasantry before the revolution.  Pay special attention to how his
    anarcho-communist beliefs are reflected in this very subjective
    document.

     Instructions: Please watch this video lecture.  The French
    Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the Estates-General
    – a general assembly representing the three French estates of the
    realm: the nobility, the church, and the common people.  Summoned by
    King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his government’s financial
    problems, the Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June
    1789 but came to an impasse as the three estates clashed over their
    respective powers.  It was brought to an end when many members of
    the Third Estate formed themselves into a National Assembly,
    signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.  On July 14th of that same
    year, the Bastille – a medieval fortress and prison which
    represented royal authority in the center of Paris – was stormed by
    a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored there.
