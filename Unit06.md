**Unit 6: The Effects of Revolution** <span id="6"></span> 
*The Atlantic world of 1776 looked very different from the Atlantic
world that emerged in 1848.  France was no longer an absolutist
monarchy.  America was no longer a collection of British colonies, but
an independent nation whose economy was becoming one of the largest in
the world.  Saint-Domingue had been transformed from a French colony in
the Caribbean into the free republic of Haiti.  New Spain had been
dismantled, and new republics and federations in Central and South
America had risen in its place.  The Industrial Revolution had
transformed Western Europe 1848 had seen an explosion of revolutionary
discontent throughout Europe.  But revolutions did not guarantee the
implementation of democratic principles and the end of oppressive
regimes.  In fact, in many regions, tyranny either returned or
persisted; freedom of the people was never assured.*  
          
 *In this unit, you will consider the Atlantic world in the wake of the
revolutionary age and compare and contrast the revolutions in Europe and
the Americas.  You will also consider how revolutionaries ended their
respective revolutions as well as how they remembered them.*
